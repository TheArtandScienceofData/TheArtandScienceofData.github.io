I am a Data Scientist in London working with Ernst & Young and was previously with Accenture. My favorite tools are R, Tableau and SQL. I use Python pretty frequently as well and dabble a bit into web development (Node.js & Flask). I also run a Data Science Fellowship which is in its first cycle called The Art and Science of Data Fellowship (or The ASD Fellowship) with seven fellows. You can learn about it [here](bit.ly/asd-fellowship).

I am very passionate about helping other women into STEM. I love binge watching TV Shows, Swimming and Twitter.
