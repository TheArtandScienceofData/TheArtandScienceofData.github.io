You're probably wondering: "What's going on here? This has nothing to do with data or art (maybe science)." Stay with me, I'll explain.

I and the lady in the picture are pretty similar. We like to apply interesting solutions to common problems. This is exactly what I hope to achieve with this blog.

We will go on a journey looking at seemingly common things through the eyes of data where we aim to find the brilliant and the unexpected. 

Join me as I take myself through this journey called Data Science. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. :)
